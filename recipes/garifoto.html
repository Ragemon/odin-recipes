        <h2>GariFoto</h2>
        <p>Ingredients</p>
        <ul>
            <li>250g of Gari</li>
            <li>1 medium Akpatogui(salted dried tilapia)</li>
            <li>2 medium herrings smoked</li>
            <li>10 medium shrimp smoked</li>
            <li>3 medium tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 medium onions sliced</li>
            <li>Vegetable oil</li>
            <li>salt</li>
            <li>3 scotch bonnets</li>
            <li>1 tsp tomato paste</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place Akpatogui in a large pot, and cover with water. Boil for about 15 minutes and pour the water away.</li>
            <li>After the fish is no longer hot, flake it and set it aside. You can also place it into the stew directly, it will flake eventually.</li>
            <li>With a knife (ideally one which is not sharp), carefully split the herrings into smaller pieces removing as many of the bones as possible.</li>
            <li>In a bowl, add hot water to the herrings to get them to soften before they're added to the stew. This should take about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>In another bowl add water, separate (and discard) the head from the rest of the shrimp and clean them. Break the shrimp apart into smaller pieces and rinse them in the water, making sure to repeat the process about 4 times. See notes.</li>
            <li>Blend shrimp with tomatoes and scotch bonnets.
            </li>
            <li>Heat vegetable oil in a pan and fry onions for about 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add tomato paste and fry for a further 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add blended tomato mix and cook for about 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Add Akpatogui, herrings, and cook the stew until thickened and cooked.
            </li>
            <li>Taste for salt only when the stew is almost cooked. Remember that the Akpatogui is very salty and the majority of its salt will be released into the stew.
            </li>
            <li>Wet the Gari slightly with water to get it damp. You do not want it soaking wet.</li>
            <li>Bit by bit, mix the stew with the damp Gari until you get a homogenous colour and a moistness you're content with.</li>
            <li>This step is optional. Heat the Gari Foto in a pan over medium heat and stir until it starts clumping together.</li>
            <li>Serve hot with fried ripe plantains, stir-fried cabbage or simply a boiled egg.
            </li>
        </ol>
