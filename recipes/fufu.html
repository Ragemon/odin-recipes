        <h2>Fufu</h2>
        <p>Ingredients</p>
        <ul>
            <li>&frac12; pound cassava</li>
            <li>&frac34;cup water</li>
            <li>&frac12; pound green plantain</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. </li>
            <li>Peel and dice plantain and cassava. (Be careful peeling the cassava: If you need help, watch a tutorial online on how to cut cassava.) Dice evenly into 1-inch squares for even cooking and combining. </li>
            <li>Parboil these ingredients until just fork-tender, about 20 to 30 minutes, over medium-low heat.</li>
            <li>Drain the water from the pot and place the hot cassava and plantain into a blender and gently begin blending the two together, very gradually adding a few tablespoons of water at a time. The starch will release and the dough will become sticky. Be super careful here so as not to over-work the mixture or add too much water (once it's in, you can't take it out!).</li>
            <li>Once blended into a coarse, grainy mixture, using a tamper blender (one that includes a plastic blender-safe stick) slowly blend and pound the mixture until it's as smooth as your blender will make it. You should still be adding a little bit of water, if needed.</li>
            <li>Once blended until smooth, add the uncooked fufu batter into a small saucepan. Place on medium-low heat. Roll up your sleeves for the next part. </li>
            <li>As soon as you light the flame, you must start vigorously and continuously stirring with a wooden spoon until the dough starts to bind together, about 5 to 7 minutes. If you see any lumps, firmly press and pound through the dough with the back of wooden spoon against the side of the pot to break down any lumps. </li>
            <li>Once it's well-combined and reaches a smooth consistency, remove from heat and place into a bowl. </li>
            <li>Divide into two portions, place into serving bowls and serve with your favorite soups or stews over the top or to eat on the side. </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Light Soup</h2>
        <p>Ingredients</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tsp of peeled and grated ginger</li>
            <li>3 cloves of garlic</li>
            <li>&frac12; tsp of ground aniseed(sekoni) or other seasoning of your choice</li>
            <li>1 heaping tsp of no-salt seasoning eg. Mrs. Dash garlic and herb</li>
            <li>&frac12; of 1 tsp of ground dried red chili pepper</li>
            <li>1 tsp salt</li>
            <li>2 small bay leaves</li>
            <li>&frac12; cup onion</li>
            <li>3 whole kpakpo shito</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Put the goat meat in a soup pot and season it with the above ingredients. Stir the goat meat well, and add &frac12; cup water to the pot. Cover, bring the water to a boil, lower the heat to simmer while you prepare a second pot with:
                <ul>
                    <li>4 oz of washed tomatoes, whole (1 large or 2 small-to-medium. I used 4 small Campari)</li>
                    <li>~4 oz of peeled onion (about 1 medium)</li>
                    <li>Fresh whole red chilli peppers to taste (probably 1 to 3, depending on type and heat), tops cut off, and seeded if you like</li>
                    <li>4 cups of water</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Bring that water to a boil and simmer 10 or 15 minutes until the vegetables are soft, then remove grind them together (in a blender or anasanka) and return them to the water in the second pot, along with 4 more cups of water.</li>
            <li>Stir in 1 tablespoon of tomato paste, let it simmer a few minutes, and add the broth to the meat. Let the soup simmer until the goat meat is tender, then remove the goat meat and, for a nice clear soup, strain the broth through a sieve, into the using a spoon if necessary to help force some of the ground vegetables through the sieve (scrape the underside of the strainer with a spoon).</li>
            <li>Return the meat to the pot and adjust the seasonings (salt, onion, tomato, pepper, etc.) to taste. This may need to simmer for a couple of hours: goat meat tends to be tougher than beef. Add a little more water if necessary.</li>
        </ol>
